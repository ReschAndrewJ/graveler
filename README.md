Open the graveler folder in VSCode and run the build task by holding Ctrl+Shift+P then entering 'tasks: run task' and selecting the build task 'C/C++: g++.exe build graveler.cpp'

(note: you must have the g++ compilier, or change the selected compiler for C++ in the tasks.json file)

After building, just run graveler.exe in Command Prompt from the graveler folder
